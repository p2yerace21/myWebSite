/*************** Algorithm ******************
1. Identify what you are trying to solve/create
2. Take each part one step at a time
3. Begin the code by identifying your global variables (assuming you have already identified the code to be html, created a head, and identified the script's language)
4. Develop a code which will link the two arrays together, corresponding 0 with 0, 1 with 1, 2 with 2, etc...
5. Create a loop that will increase an integer every time it's passes through for the array variable
6. Once the loop has completed, write an if statement which will test the code
7. Complete the page by providing a link back the the home page, and close the body and html script
8. Congratulations
